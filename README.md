blaze-weblink
==========
blaze-weblink is an extendible service that allows dispatching to other resources via HTTP

What is it?
===========

blaze-weblink is a service that can be used to dispatch URLs to other resources.
The original intent is to provide a URL shortening and aliasing service with expiration support.

Possible future features are
* Statistics for URLs
* Support for URL-Rewriting instead of aliasing
* Restrict access to IPs

How to use it?
==============
Currently you have to build it yourself, but soon we will publish the version 1.0 to
the Maven Central.
 
Licensing
